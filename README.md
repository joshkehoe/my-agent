## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **agents-cli**: Agents CLI - Install with `uv tool install google-agents-cli`
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)


## Quick Start

Install `agents-cli` and its skills if not already installed:

```bash
uvx google-agents-cli setup
```

Install required packages:

```bash
agents-cli install
```

Test the agent with a local web server:

```bash
agents-cli playground
```

You can also use features from the [ADK](https://adk.dev/) CLI with `uv run adk`.

## Development

Edit your agent logic in `app/agent.py` and test with `agents-cli playground` - it auto-reloads on save.

## Deployment

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
agents-cli deploy
```

To add CI/CD and Terraform, run `agents-cli scaffold enhance`.
To set up your production infrastructure, run `agents-cli infra cicd`.

## Observability

Built-in telemetry exports to Cloud Trace, BigQuery, and Cloud Logging.

## A2A Inspector

This agent supports the [A2A Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/). Use the [A2A Inspector](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector) to test interoperability.
See the [A2A Inspector docs](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector) for details.

## AI-native PM learning feed

The agent curates learning material for becoming an AI-native product manager, focused on
[Product Faculty](https://productfaculty.com) and its founder and instructors. Items are grouped by
topic with short bullet summaries. You can mark items read, save them for later, or dismiss them, and
star your favorites (there's a Favorites filter) and write your own notes on them.

- **Chat with it:** `agents-cli playground`, then ask e.g. "what's new on evals?", "save item 4",
  "star item 7" or "add a note to item 7: try this in our next roadmap review".
- **Browse and triage:** `uv run uvicorn app.feed.web:app --port 8090`, then open <http://127.0.0.1:8090>.
- **Refresh content:** `uv run python -m app.feed.ingest` (reads the Product Faculty sitemap and searches the
  web for the instructors' recent public writing; never LinkedIn). Existing items and your read /
  saved / dismissed choices are never overwritten.

Data is stored locally in `data/feed.db` (git-ignored). Set `FEED_DB_PATH` to move it.
Sources and topics live in `app/feed/sources.py`.
